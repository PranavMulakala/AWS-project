Title: Building a Serverless Web Application on AWS

Project Name: Serverless Web Application on AWS

Project Description:
I am embarking on the journey of creating a serverless web application using the power of AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3. The heart of this application lies in its ability to empower users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on items stored within a DynamoDB table.

Project Architecture:
Let's take a closer look at the architecture of our Serverless Web Application on AWS.

Steps to Build the Project:

I will begin by establishing a DynamoDB table to serve as our trusted data repository.
Next, I will roll up my sleeves and dive into the development of a Lambda function, diligently tasked with managing all CRUD operations on our DynamoDB table.
The static files that power our web application, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, will find their home in the reliable confines of Amazon S3.
To ensure that our static files are delivered to our users with the utmost efficiency and minimal latency, I will configure a CloudFront distribution.
Expected Outcome:
Upon the triumphant completion of this project, I will stand tall with a fully functional serverless web application, hosted gracefully on the AWS platform. This immersive experience will not only enrich me with the practical wisdom of constructing serverless applications using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and CloudFront but will also deepen my proficiency in harnessing AWS services and seamlessly integrating them into a unified solution.

This project offers an invaluable opportunity to elevate my expertise in cloud computing, embrace the intricacies of serverless architecture, and master the art of working with AWS services.
