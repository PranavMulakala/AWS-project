Title: Building a Serverless Web Application on AWS

Project Name: Serverless Web Application on AWS

Project Description:
I created a serverless web application using the power of AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3. The application heavily lies in its ability to empower users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on items stored within a DynamoDB table.

Project Architecture:
Let's take a closer look at the architecture of our Serverless Web Application on AWS.

Steps to Build the Project:

I will establish a DynamoDB table to serve as our trusted data repository.
Next, I dive into the development of a Lambda function, diligently tasked with managing all CRUD operations on our DynamoDB table.
The static files that power our web application, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, will be found in Amazon S3.
I will configure a CloudFront distribution to ensure that our static files are delivered to our users with the utmost efficiency and minimal latency.

Expected Outcome:
SA fully functional serverless web application hosted gracefully on the AWS platform. This immersive experience will not only enrich me with the practical wisdom of constructing serverless applications using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and CloudFront. Still, it will also deepen my proficiency in harnessing AWS services and seamlessly integrating them into a unified solution.

This project offers an invaluable opportunity to elevate my expertise in cloud computing, embrace the power of serverless architecture, and master the art of working with AWS services.
